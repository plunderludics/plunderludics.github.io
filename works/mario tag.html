<blockquote>
<p>The Super Mario franchise, originating from Nintendo in 1985, is a seminal work in video game history. Set in the whimsical Mushroom Kingdom, players assume the role of Mario, joined by his brother Luigi, on quests to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser. The game mechanics, featuring platforming challenges and strategic power-up items like the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, offer a diverse and engaging experience. Its enduring popularity and scholarly interest make it a pivotal subject in the gaming industry.    </p>
<p>Exploring techniques the artists call "plunderludics," "Mario Tag" is a remix of sorts. By creating a custom emulator that changes how the original game is presented, while keeping the software untouched, "Mario Tag" is a fresh twist on Super Mario Bros: two players embody the iconic plumber, Mario, at the same time, engaging in an electrifying chase through different levels of the Mushroom Kingdom. Adding to the excitement is the 360-degree screen, allowing the pursuit to extend indefinitely. Each time a player dies, the world morphs randomly, injecting unpredictability into the gameplay. The competing Marios try to hold on to a 'ball' for the longest amount of time to win. Experience the fusion of fun and innovation in "Mario Tag," where the pursuit never cease   </p>

<p>this game was originally commissioned to run on a 360 screen, at the Hong Kong University, and can be modified to fit any other 360 screen.   </p>
<p>an alternative installation, done for <a href="/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">boshi's place 1 year anniversary</a>, called the "circle" build used throw projectors, perpendicular to each other and pointing towards the ground, which allowed players to experience being inside the piece without the necessity of a 360 screen. <code>I</code>and <code>O</code> change the inner and outer radius of the circle respectively.    </p>
<p>input, can be remapped with joy2key, previous installations used these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWITATA-Controller-PC-Rechargeable-Linux-Unix/dp/B08X6FSRPQ" class="external-link">wireless NES style controllers</a>   </p>
