<p>many times while sampling, you will want to have a save state that has already progressed through the game so you don't have to do it yourself   </p>
<p>you can look up online for a <strong>SaveRAM</strong> of the particular game you are looking for, <a href="https://www.zophar.net/savestates/n64.html" class="external-link" title="https://www.zophar.net/savestates/">this website</a> has a bunch of them for example.   </p>
<p>Using a downloaded SaveRAM file   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in order to use these with <a href="/tools/bizhawk.html">bizhawk</a>, launch and close the rom that you are interested in getting the save for, lets say, <em>Mario Party 2</em> for the <em>N64</em>.    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then navigate on the bizhawk directory to the location of the SaveRAMs for the system for the game, in this case <code>Bizkawhk/N64/SaveRAM</code>   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="/guides/using%20preexisting%20save%20files/Pasted%20image%2020240619013114.png" />   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>copy the name of the game in this folder <code>Mario Party 2 (USA).SaveRAM</code>    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take the SaveRAM file you downloaded (it might not have .SaveRAM as an extension), and rename the whole file name, including the extension, to the name you copied before   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="/guides/using%20preexisting%20save%20files/Pasted%20image%2020240619013646.png" />   </p>
<ul>
<li>now replace this new file onto the previous folder   </li>
<li>and there you have it, your beautiful new save file, will all you want!</li>
