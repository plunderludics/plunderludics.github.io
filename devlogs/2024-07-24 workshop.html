<p>We put on a two day workshop at <a href="boshis.place" class="external-link">boshi's place</a> in Brooklyn. Basically a demo of how to make plunders using <a href="/tools/unityhawk.html">UnityHawk</a>, then the second part was a jam where we picked three random games and everyone made a plunder using the same three games. Check out all the games made for the jam <a href="https://itch.io/jam/plunderludics-workshop-jam/entries" class="external-link">here</a>.   </p>
<p>The first part of the stream was recorded and can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwgu7M3NGxo" class="external-link">here</a>.</p></div>
