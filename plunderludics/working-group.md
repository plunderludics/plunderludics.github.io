# plunderludics working group
We are [mut moochi](https://twitter.com/mutmedia), [Jonny Hopkins](https://twitter.com/jwhopkin), and [Gurn Group](https://twitter.com/gurnburial). We are game developers with a common interest in a style of game development we call 'plunderludics', meaning using existing videogames as raw material to make new videogames (think collage, remix, sampling, etc.) Our work so far has involved historical research, curation, tool development, and game design. 

Important points of inspiration areÂ [plunderphonics](https://plunderphonics.com/xhtml/xplunder.html), [*Metagaming*](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/metagaming), [Myfanwy Ashmore](https://myfanwy.ca/html/mario.html), [Cory Arcangel](https://coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/2004-003-super-slow-tetris), [100 Free Beetles](https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/10585), [*Oikospiel*](https://dkoikos.itch.io/oikospiel), and [*Multibowl*](http://www.foddy.net/2016/08/multibowl/), among many others.
