We put on a two day workshop at [boshi's place](boshis.place) in Brooklyn. Basically a demo of how to make plunders using [[UnityHawk]], then the second part was a jam where we picked three random games and everyone made a plunder using the same three games. Check out all the games made for the jam [here](https://itch.io/jam/plunderludics-workshop-jam/entries).

The first part of the stream was recorded and can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwgu7M3NGxo).
