(Copy text from instagram/twitter post)

Hosted at Boshi's Place: 1002 Metropolitan Ave, Brooklyn
And online on twitch: twitch.tv/boshisplace/home

This workshop is aimed at people who have a rough familiarity with the Unity engine, but anybody is welcome to come along regardless.
Anyone who can only make it to one of the two days, or can't stay for the whole event, is also welcome.

### Setup
