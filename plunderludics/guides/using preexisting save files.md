many times while sampling, you will want to have a save state that has already progressed through the game so you don't have to do it yourself

you can look up online for a **SaveRAM** of the particular game you are looking for, [this website](https://www.zophar.net/savestates/n64.html "https://www.zophar.net/savestates/") has a bunch of them for example.

Using a downloaded SaveRAM file

- in order to use these with [[bizhawk]], launch and close the rom that you are interested in getting the save for, lets say, *Mario Party 2* for the *N64*. 

- then navigate on the bizhawk directory to the location of the SaveRAMs for the system for the game, in this case `Bizkawhk/N64/SaveRAM`

- copy the name of the game in this folder `Mario Party 2 (USA).SaveRAM` 

- take the SaveRAM file you downloaded (it might not have .SaveRAM as an extension), and rename the whole file name, including the extension, to the name you copied before

- now replace this new file onto the previous folder
- and there you have it, your beautiful new save file, will all you want!
