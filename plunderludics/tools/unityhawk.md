UnityHawk is a library (developed by the [[working-group|plunderludics working group]]) for running [[bizhawk]] inside of Unity, intended for more convenient plunderludic development and making it possible to distribute bizhawk-based plunders as standalone apps. Windows-only for now, sadly.
See the [Github repo](https://github.com/plunderludics/unity-hawk) for more information.
In mid-2024 we gave a workshop on using UnityHawk which can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwgu7M3NGxo).

See also the [[plundertools]] library which adds some extra functionality on top of UnityHawk.
