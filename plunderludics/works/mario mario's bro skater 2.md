an experiment in making a mash up of two existing videogames in order to create a third game. having Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 running in the background, with its interface layered on the top of an of Super Mario 64, moving Mario through space gets recontextualized from having to get somewhere and collect items into moving around the courtyard as if on a skateboard. what does it mean for Mario to do a kickflip?
